    <h2>What are drugs?</h2>
    
    <p class = "big">Drugs are substances that affect an organism's physiology or psychology. Medicine, because it affects certain parts of the body 
    (i.e. blocks neurotransmitters to reduce nausea), is considered a drug. However, drugs generally have side effects, and some side effects are worse 
    than others. It's mainly because of these varying side effects that children are told not to take drugs, even though it includes medications. </p>

    <h2>Why Do People Take Drugs?</h2>
    
    <p class = "big">Peer pressure, curiousity, and simple enjoyment of the effects of drugs are all contributing factors. Afterwards, addiction may 
    become a problem. But initially, people continue taking drugs because they enjoy the high it can give them. </p>

    <p>My name is Jen Cooper, and I'm 16 years old. I'm currently attending my junior year of high school, and contrary to my attendance at a hackathon 
    may lead you to believe, my main interests lie in biochemistry and biomedicine. I hope to be able to develop better medications for diseases and 
    illnesses that plague millions of people per year. 
      <br>
      <br>
    Neuroscience and material science also lie within my interests, and I heavily support the nonprofit organizations to help struggling communities 
    in this world, either in their education, financial situation, healthcare, or acceptance with the public.</p>
